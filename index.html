				<p>
					Hello, my name is Jun. I'm a 17 year old high school student who lives in Ontario. <br><br>
					I've played osu for about 3 years now, during which I've reached several milestones in the game such as becoming the top player in Canada and reaching a peak rank of <b>#53</b> global. 
					However, I'm not nearly as active as I used to be nowadays.<br><br>
					I also work on small projects from time to time, which I think I'll post here.
